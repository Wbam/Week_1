# Quantitative Analysis Technical Indicators Analysis

## Overview

This project is dedicated to analyzing historical stock data to compute and visualize key technical indicators using Python libraries TA-Lib and PyNance. The analysis focuses on understanding stock performance through the following indicators:

- **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: Helps identify the trend direction by smoothing out price data.
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Measures the speed and change of price movements to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions.
- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**: Analyzes the relationship between two moving averages to determine potential buy or sell signals.

### Libraries Used

- **TA-Lib**: Provides a wide range of technical analysis indicators used to perform complex financial calculations efficiently.
- **PyNance**: A library for advanced financial calculations and metrics.

## Project Files

- **`QuantitativeAnalysis.py`**: Contains Python functions for loading stock data, computing technical indicators using TA-Lib and PyNance, and visualizing financial metrics.
- **`QuantitativeAnalysis.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook that provides an interactive environment to run the analysis workflow. It includes steps for loading data, computing indicators, and visualizing results.
